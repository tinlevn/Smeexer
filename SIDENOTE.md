# Thoughts and contemplations 

## Original inspiration for Smeexer

There are already many great solutions for storing seed phrases\
out there. For instance, there are products sold right now on the\
Internet that will inscribe and lock cryptocurrency wallet seed phrases\
onto metal pieces that are corrosion resistant, water-proof and fire-proof.

However, they are usually inaccessible or too unaffordable for the masses.\
I envision a future where everybody will be empowered and endowed with the\
abilities to become their own banks, in this case, having and managing their\
own crypto-assets. And if such a future is to become a reality, then the lock boxes\
of the future will not be inches-thick safes but rather simple software wallets that
are safeguarded by the simple, human-readable 12 english words (that are also being\
translated into many other languages). 

If everybody can easily write down these seed phrases, then criminals can also easily\
blackmail, phish people out of, or using violence to rob people of their seed phrases to\
steal other people's funds. 

I personally think by simply mixing the seed phrases out of its correct order, applying\
different methods on the same phrase, and obscuring it by adding a valid key phrase set\
into it will immensely increase the security of offline wallet storage because if the physical\
copy of the keys are stolen (in this case, the 12 or 24 words), there is an infinitesimal chance\
of the bad actor being able to guess or predict the correct seed phrase.

Also, building a program to reverse engineer or to guess the correct phrase is\
uneconomical, time-consuming, and even unproductive. 

With Smeexer, most people will have an easier time making more copies of their\
seed phrases either offline, or even put it in their cellphone note apps or\
cloud note services such as Google Note.
