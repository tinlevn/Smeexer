Offline seed phrase security enhancements \
*Smeexer is a pun on Seed-mixer.*

## What is Smeexer?

Smeexer is an offline Python/script program  
I created to scramble the ordering of the 
common 12-24-words-long mnemonic seed phrases
that many popular cryptocurrency wallets use to  
store their private keys.
The mechanics behind the process of generating 
private keys from the 12-24-words-long seed phrases
will not be covered here. 

However, they are discussed in-depth at these blog posts and web pages:
* [Journey from mnemonic phrase to Address](https://medium.com/mycrypto/the-journey-from-mnemonic-phrase-to-address-6c5e86e11e14)
* [What are Seed Phrases, Private Keys, Public Keys, Public Addresses?

## Who is Smeexer for?

Smeexer is for anybody who wants (seeks) to increase
the security of the mnemonic phrases that are written offline,
on pieces of paper.\
Cold storage is the safest method of storing cryptocurrency.
However, there is always a chance of losing one's funds (or access to the funds)
if: 
- The owner forgets his or her seed phrases 
- The owner loses the physical template where he or she inscribed the phrases; 
- A thief (bad actor, criminal) somehow gains access to the copy of the physical seed phrases\
  (not through computer hacking nor network penetration).

**Notice**: *These scenarios are speaking strictly of\
the physical breach of the seeds, not a digital one.\
If your computer or smartphones which contain your\
cryptowallet(s) are compromised (hacked, penetrated, i,e. a keylogger),\
then mixing your seeds will not help to secure your funds.*

## Why use Smeexer?
Smeexer is created so that crypto holders can create more physical copies\
of their seed phrases because even if seeds are lost or stolen,\
whoever picking them up will have a near zero chance of recovering the\
original crypto wallet because he or she does not know:
- The original order of the phrases
- How many words are in the correct phrase (12? 16? 24?)
- The mixing method that the owner chose to mix his/her phrase

Hence, Smeexer allows its users to make more physical copies of\
their seed phrases and scatter them in different locations, essentially\
backing them up in the real world with added security without having\
to worry about them being destroyed, lost, or stolen.

## How it works
### The mixing methods and their names
    
## Roadmap
- Date: 1st April, 2021
    - A new obfuscate method
    - Sharding: splitting the original seeds into smaller\
      fractions and mix in random words 
    - A real user interface that is easy to use for everyone\
        since only advanced users can 
---
## *Disclaimer* 
**Please use Smeexer offline due to the risk of
your computer being compromised.\
No data is stored for this application, 
there will never be a feature to export the seeds.\
All the results of mixing will only be printed and not written\
to any external files (.csv, .txt, or .pdf).\
Write all phrases down carefully**
***
**AND PLEASE REMEMBER THE MIXING METHOD CHOSEN TO MIX YOUR SEED PHRASE
BECAUSE YOU CAN REVERSE THE PROCESS TO RECOVER THE ORIGINAL SEEDS AND SEED ORDER**
